Coffee Club allows users to:
- create an account
- share details of coffee blends they're drinking
- keep a list of all coffees they've tasted in one place
- share and see specific names, origins, varieties, notes, intensifiers, and ratings for any coffees users around the world have tried
- edit their own coffees
- delete their own coffees
